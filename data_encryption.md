## Data Encrytpion UI for Cloud Storage
---
### Background
This project was developed for a start-up to encrypt sensitive proprietary files to be shared over the cloud, via email, or anywhere. This app was developed using the [cryptography package](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) in the backend and Tkinter for the front end. The UI is very minimalist, consisting of just 2 screens: 
#### a log-in screen 
that doesn't allow any file encryption/decryption until correct password is entered

#### and the encrypt/decrypt screen
which opens a file browser and sends the file through the selected process.

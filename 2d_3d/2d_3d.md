## 3D to 2D G-code Optimizing Tool

### Background:

Since 2015, I have been working on a homemade CNC Laser Cutter. The 2 Watt laser is capable of cutting though thick paper, 3/16" foamcore, and balsa wood with enough passes. This is great for making 2 dimensional art or cutting things down to exact sizes, but not great for 3 dimensional structures. In order to solve this problem, I turned to inspiration from 3D printing, which is nothing more than a series of (roughly) 2-dimensional layers stacked on top of each other. Cutting out these layers and stacking them together was a viable option. Using thicker materials would reduce the number of layers needed, but also reduce the Z-axis resolution of the 3D object.

I created a 3D model in Autodesk Fusion 360, exported the STL file, and imported that to 3D printer slicer software, Cura, with a custom profile that exports a 3D G-code file with layers at designated layer heights. Using an infill of 0, the program exports only an outline of the object to be cut. This was the easy part, but wouldn't allow me to use it on the laser quite yet, since all of the layers were still stacked on top of each other.
